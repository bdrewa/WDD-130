            <h1>Welcome to Bounce and Beyond</h1>
            <p> What We Offer. At Bounce and Beyond, we specialize in creating fun, flexible, and functional event experiences for all ages. Our rental options include two bounce castles to suit different event needs. We offer a small bounce house perfect for backyards, toddlers, or more casual gatherings and a large, commercial-grade inflatable ideal for bigger parties, school events, and community festivals. Both are cleaned and inspected after every use for your safety and peace of mind. But we don't stop there. We're expanding our services to include full wedding equipment rentals and professional DJ services. If you're planning a wedding and need tables, chairs, arches, lighting, or decor, we have curated options to help you create a beautiful setup without the hefty price tag. We want to bring the same ease and joy to your special day as we do to our bounce house rentals. And for the ultimate party experience, you can now book our wedding DJ service for just $500. We offer a complete sound system, curated playlists, event coordination, and an energetic host to keep the celebration going. Whether you need soft background music or a packed dance floor, we're ready to help bring your vision to life. No matter what you're celebrating, we're here to make it special.</p>
